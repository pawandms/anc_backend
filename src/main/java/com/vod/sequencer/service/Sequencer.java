/**
 * A tool for the automatic generation of unique numbers. This class
 * goes to the database once every <code>MAX_KEYS</code> requests to
 * get a new seed for the numbers it generates. This class is thread-safe,
 * meaning multiple threads can be safely requesting unique numbers from it.
 * It is also multi-process safe. In other words, multiple machines can
 * simultaneously be generating unique values and those values will
 * be guaranteed to be unique across all applications. The only caveat
 * is that they all must be using the same algorithm for generating
 * the numbers and getting seeds from the same database. In order to
 * access the database, this class expects a system property called
 * <code>org.dasein.persist.SequencerDSN</code>. It should be set to the
 * name of the DSN that provides connections to the database with the
 * <code>Sequencer</code> table. That table should have the
 * following <code>CREATE</code>:
 * <span class="code">
 * CREATE TABLE Sequencer (
 *     name        VARCHAR(20)     NOT NULL,
 *     seed        BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
 *     lastUpdate  BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
 *     PRIMARY KEY ( name, lastUpdate )
 * );
